Don't you hate it when a website is down and you need the information on it? You're clever, so you do a Google search of the URL of the page you want and then select the cached result. However, if you want to follow any of the links on the cached page you have to copy the URL, go back to Google, search on the URL, click on the little arrow, and select "Cached" to finally get where you want to go. Then you have to repeat that process if you want to continue browsing that site through the Google Cache.

When you enable the Google Cache Browser all links will be transformed into Google Cache links. When you visit a page in the Google Cache all of the links on that page will also become Google Cache links. You can seamlessly browse websites through the Google Cache just by pressing a button.

When you're done browsing through the Google Cache on that tab simply press the Google Cache Browser button again to turn it off. Simple!

Additionally, in this new version, when you get a 404 or 503 response from the server we display the option of browsing the page, full path, host, or domain in the Google Cache. It's seamless and unobtrusive. It'll only show up when you need it.
